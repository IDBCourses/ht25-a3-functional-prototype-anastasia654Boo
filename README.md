~ PUMPKIN LIFE ~
We heard that you like to play games :0
In this program you have one goal - keep the pumpkin alive.


Info and instructions:
- the keyboard is divided into left side and right side
  'keyH' decided to join the "right side team"
- you need to press right and left keys to move the pumpkin
  so it wont hit the obstacles
- if the obstacle hits the pumpkin - it dies and you start again

- obstacles are set to random hue
  which means that their colour may match the colour of the background 
  (it is named wall in the code)
- to see hidded obstacles you will need to change the hue of the background
  which you can do by using the digits key row swipe
  e.g. swipe '1234567890-=' keys in right or left direction


IMPORTANT:
- the hue change feature may seem unuseful at first, 
  but we ask you to be patient
- the overlapping function may not work well all the time
  (David said that it's ok)
  the BEST SCREEN RATIO is about 2:3
  e.g. it would take about half-third part of the screen
  but you are free to experiment 

  GOOD LUCK!
